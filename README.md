# Kantan Assets

This converts audio files and images into a format consumable by Kantan Player.

## Audio conversion

A directory of well-named and well-tagged audio files will be converted into a directory of re-encoded audio files with metadata stored in a file named `tracks.json`.

## Image conversion

A high resolution cover image named `cover.jpg` or `cover.png` and a high resolution art image named `art.jpg` or `art.png` will both be converted into multiple sizes.
